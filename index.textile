h2. Everyone can be a programmer

**Build Something Awesome** is built around the idea that computer programming should be accessible to everyone.  Writing computer programs is simply a modern form of creative expression and should be as easy to get started with as finger-painting or playing the guitar.  Admittedly, computer programming today still involves a bit of arcane knowledge, but smoothing over the confusing parts is what Build Something Awesome is all about.  All of the projects on this website are designed to be able to be completed in less than two hours.  So welcome, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you create!  --Aaron V.
