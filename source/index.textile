h2. Next Livestream--Sat, Oct 27th, 10am PDT / 1pm EDT / 5pm GMT

This week we'll be doing another Java project, this time making a game to scare your friends and family with for Halloween!  I'll also be sure to quickly cover the installation of IntelliJ for those who had trouble last week, and I've worked out the kinks with the chat room sign up, so feel welcome to chime in during the cast.  See you then!

You can <a href="{{ root_url }}/livestream.html">tune in here</a>, or on <a href="http://www.justin.tv/avh4">justin.tv</a>.  And if you'd like a reminder, you can <a href="http://eepurl.com/qngd5">sign up to be notified when the livestream is about to start</a>.

h2. Everyone can be a programmer

Have you ever finger-painted, noodled around on a guitar, or tried to write a story?  Chances are you've given at least one of those a try.

But what about writing a computer program?  **Build Something Awesome** is built around the idea that computer programming should be just as accessible as any other art form.

Admittedly, computer programming today still involves a bit of arcane knowledge, but smoothing over the confusing parts is what Build Something Awesome is all about.  All of the projects on this website are designed to be able to be completed in less than two hours.  So welcome, and I'm looking forward to seeing what you create!
