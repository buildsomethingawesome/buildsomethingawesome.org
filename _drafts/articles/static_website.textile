h2. Building a static website in 2 hours

This first version of this website was built in 2 hours, and below I'll be describing the steps I took to do it.  With the given tools, hopefully you'll be able to build your own website and get it up and running in a short amount of time.  From there, let your creativity run wild!

h3. Starting out

The very first thing I do for a new project is create a folder for it.  I usually create the new folder either on my Desktop, or in my "Dropbox":http://www.dropbox.com folder.  Once I'm no longer actively using a project, I move it from the Desktop to my Documents/Projects folder.

For this project, I created a folder called "Build Something Awesome Website" in my Dropbox folder.

h3. :00 Design Research

My first step was to come up with some ideas for a design I liked.  I started with a search for "best website designs":http://www.google.com/search?q=best+website+designs, and gathered some screenshots of ones I found that I thought matched the feeling I wanted my website to convey.

I created a folder called "Design inspiration" inside of my "Build Something Awesome Website" folder, and saved the screenshots there.  Here are a few I liked from "an article at hongkait.com":http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/11-most-popular-blog-design-styles-with-examples/:
